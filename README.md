# alex-bloggy-blog
I wanted this to be a personal blog that showcased my thoughts and experiences,unfortunately,this was not my best effort. I ran out of time and could not get things to connect.
I am turning in what I can, and will learn from this opportunity.

## Description

This repository was supposed to contain my solution for the Module 4 Challenge - Personal Blog.

I tried to show what I can do, by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web API knowledge to:

- Create a two-page website where users will input and view blog posts.
- It was supposed to include building a content form, dynamically rendering blog posts, and implementing a light/dark mode toggle.
- This project was supposed to help me: gain practical JavaScript experience, explore the Document Object Model's power, and set the stage for more advanced tasks.

## Credits

Credit to Jasper Garcia, my son, who helps me troubleshoot when I am stuck. I was able to ask him questions to clarify, and he promted and challenged me to take breaks and allow my mind to process the solutions which were brewing.

Thanks to Krystal Stanton for assistance and references when I was stuck and her encouragement!

When stuck, I also referenced the following sites:

- The supplied code throughout the lessons.
- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/>
- <https://stackoverflow.com/>
- <https://google.com/>
- <https://bing.com/>


I referenced code (HTML and CSS) from the UT provided lessons, however, I wrote all my own changes, edits, tweaks, and versions of my webpage, html, and css.

I commented and committed to my repo heavily.

I was not able to deploy without succesfully. :(
