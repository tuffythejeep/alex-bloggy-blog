# alex-bloggy-blog
A personal blog that showcases my thoughts and experiences.

## Description

This repository contains my solution for the Module 4 Challenge - Personal Blog.

In order for work to show what I can do, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web API knowledge to:

- Create a two-page website where users will input and view blog posts.
- It includes building a content form, dynamically rendering blog posts, and implementing a light/dark mode toggle.
- This project helped me: gain practical JavaScript experience, explore the Document Object Model's power, and set the stage for more advanced tasks.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each section on this page was laid out based on Semantic HTML styling and tags, as I deleted non-semantic HTML elements. I also ensured my css file contained all appropriate styling elements so my version of the webpage mirrored the UT Challenge source file, when rendered on a browser.

I used Chrome console (inspect) to ensure my edits, adjustments, changes, and tweaks rendered correctly.

## Credits

Credit to Jasper Garcia, my son, who helps me troubleshoot when I am stuck - however, I wrote all my own JavaScript. I was able to ask him questions to clarify, and he promted and challenged me to take breaks and allow my mind to process the solutions which were brewing.

Thanks to Travis Haynie for assistance when I was stuck and his encouragement!

When stuck, I referenced the following sites:

- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/>
- <https://stackoverflow.com/>
- <https://google.com/>
- <https://bing.com/>


I referenced code (HTML and CSS) from the UT provided lessons, however, I wrote all my own changes, edits, tweaks, and versions of my webpage, html, and css.

No outside sources of text, html, or css were copied into my work.

I commented and committed to my repo heavily.

I was able to deploy without issue, once I copied all htlm and css files properly.
